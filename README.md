### Hi there üëã I'm Zach

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer just starting out in my coding career. I'm interested in gaming, online communities, and emerging technologies, especially medical tech as I was in emergency medicine for the first ten years of my adult life.

## Some of the skills I have picked up along the way:
- Javascript
- React
- MaterialUI
- Styled Components
- Node.js
- Express
- SQLite3
- PostgreSQL
- HTML
- CSS
- Python
- and counting...
